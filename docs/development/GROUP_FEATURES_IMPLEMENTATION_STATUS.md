# Group Features Implementation Status

**Created:** 2025-12-30  
**Purpose:** Honest assessment of what's actually implemented vs. what's just database schema

## 🎯 Summary

**You're absolutely right.** I was describing features that **don't exist yet**. Here's the reality:

## ✅ What's Actually Implemented

### 1. Groups (Core)
- ✅ Database: `groups` table
- ✅ Service: `mutations/groups.ts`, `queries/groups.ts`
- ✅ API: `/api/groups/route.ts`
- ✅ UI: `CreateGroupDialog`, `GroupDetail`, `GroupsDashboard`
- ✅ **Status:** Fully functional

### 2. Members
- ✅ Database: `group_members` table
- ✅ Service: `mutations/members.ts`, `queries/members.ts`
- ✅ API: `/api/groups/[slug]/members/route.ts`
- ✅ UI: `GroupMembers` component
- ✅ **Status:** Fully functional

### 3. Invitations
- ✅ Database: `group_invitations`; answered only through `accept_group_invitation` /
  `decline_group_invitation`, which require the invitation to name the caller
  (migration `20261007171000_an_invitation_is_for_its_invitee_only.sql`)
- ✅ Domain: `src/domain/groups/invitations.server.ts` — the one implementation
  (the browser-side `services/groups/*/invitations.ts` copy was removed 2026-10-07)
- ✅ API: `POST/GET /api/groups/[slug]/invitations`, `POST/DELETE /api/invitations/[id]`
- ✅ The invitee gets a `group_invite` notification linking to
  `/dashboard/invitations/[id]`, where they accept or decline
- ✅ Cat's `invite_to_organization` uses the same domain path
- ⛔ Link and e-mail invitations: not offered (no join page, no mail)
- ✅ **Status:** Fully functional (until 2026-10-07 it was not: accepting failed
  on group_members' RLS, and no invitee was ever told)

### 4. Events
- ✅ Database: `group_events`, `group_event_rsvps` tables
- ✅ Service: `mutations/events.ts`, `queries/events.ts`
- ✅ API: `/api/groups/[slug]/events/route.ts`
- ✅ UI: Event components
- ✅ **Status:** Fully functional

### 5. Wallets/Treasury
- ✅ Database: `group_wallets` table
- ✅ Service: `mutations/wallets.ts`, `queries/wallets.ts`
- ✅ API: `/api/groups/[slug]/wallets/route.ts`
- ✅ UI: `GroupWallets` component
- ✅ **Status:** Fully functional

## ❌ What's NOT Implemented (But Has Database Schema)

### 1. Proposals

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Database: `group_proposals` table (in migration)
- ✅ Feature config: `proposals` in `group-features.ts`
- ✅ RLS policies: Defined in migration

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Service layer: No `mutations/proposals.ts`
- ❌ Service layer: No `queries/proposals.ts`
- ❌ API routes: No `/api/groups/[slug]/proposals/route.ts`
- ❌ API routes: No `/api/groups/[slug]/proposals/[id]/route.ts`
- ❌ UI components: No proposal creation form
- ❌ UI components: No proposal list/view
- ❌ UI components: No proposal management

**What Needs to Be Done:**
Following the development guide pattern (like events/invitations):
1. Create `src/services/groups/mutations/proposals.ts`
2. Create `src/services/groups/queries/proposals.ts`
3. Create `src/app/api/groups/[slug]/proposals/route.ts`
4. Create `src/app/api/groups/[slug]/proposals/[id]/route.ts`
5. Create UI components for proposals
6. Add to `GroupsService` class
7. Export from `groups/index.ts`

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours (following established patterns)

### 2. Voting

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Database: `group_votes` table (in migration)
- ✅ Feature config: `voting` in `group-features.ts`
- ✅ RLS policies: Defined in migration
- ✅ Permission system: Has `requiresVote` logic in `permissions/resolver.ts`

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Service layer: No `mutations/votes.ts`
- ❌ Service layer: No `queries/votes.ts`
- ❌ API routes: No `/api/groups/[slug]/proposals/[id]/vote/route.ts`
- ❌ UI components: No voting interface
- ❌ UI components: No vote tracking/display

**What Needs to Be Done:**
1. Create `src/services/groups/mutations/votes.ts`
2. Create `src/services/groups/queries/votes.ts`
3. Create `src/app/api/groups/[slug]/proposals/[id]/vote/route.ts`
4. Create UI components for voting
5. Integrate with proposals (voting happens on proposals)
6. Add to `GroupsService` class

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours (following established patterns)

## 🎯 What I Incorrectly Described

In the apartment building guide, I described:

1. ❌ **"Create proposals"** - Not implemented
2. ❌ **"Residents vote"** - Not implemented
3. ❌ **"Proposal approval"** - Not implemented
4. ❌ **"Funds released from treasury"** - Not implemented (no proposal execution)

**What Actually Works:**
- ✅ Create building group
- ✅ Add members
- ✅ Create building asset
- ✅ Link asset to group
- ✅ Create events (meetings)
- ✅ Manage wallets/treasury
- ✅ Invite members

**What Doesn't Work Yet:**
- ❌ Create proposals
- ❌ Vote on proposals
- ❌ Execute proposals (release funds)
- ❌ Track proposal status

## 📝 Corrected Apartment Building Guide

**What You Can Actually Do Right Now:**

1. ✅ Create building group
2. ✅ Add residents as members
3. ✅ Create building asset
4. ✅ Link asset to group
5. ✅ Set up treasury (Bitcoin address)
6. ✅ Create events (building meetings)
7. ✅ Invite members

**What You CAN'T Do Yet:**

1. ❌ Create proposals for decisions
2. ❌ Vote on proposals
3. ❌ Execute proposals (automatic fund release)
4. ❌ Track proposal history

**Workaround:**
- Use events for building meetings
- Discuss decisions in events
- Manually manage treasury (no proposal-driven spending)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

To make proposals and voting work, we need to:

1. **Follow the established pattern** (like events/invitations)
2. **Use the development guide** (service layer pattern)
3. **Implement incrementally:**
   - Start with proposals (CRUD)
   - Then add voting
   - Then add execution logic

**Estimated Total Time:** 8-10 hours following the guide

## 💡 Lesson Learned

**Always verify implementation status before describing features.**

The database schema exists, but that's only 20% of the work. The service layer, API routes, and UI components are the other 80%.

**I apologize for the confusion.** The guide I created described an ideal system, not the current reality.
